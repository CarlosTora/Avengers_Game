This is a little program I did for JS practice. 
In which the Avengers fight Thanos in turns. 

First the avengers attack, and if after his attacks, 
Thanos is still alive, he snaps his fingers and has a 50% kill rate of the Avengers (individually) 
if after snapping his fingers there are Avengers alive, they continue to fight against Thanos.
